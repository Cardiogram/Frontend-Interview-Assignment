# Cardiogram Frontend Interview

Welcome to Cardiogram's frontend interview! You'll be using this repository as boilerplate towards your project. You should have received instructions on your assignment.

### Setup

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cardiogram/frontend-interview-assignment.git .
npm i
```

### Running in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Webpack Dev Server that serves assets in the `/src` directory (it will refresh the page on changes)

You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
